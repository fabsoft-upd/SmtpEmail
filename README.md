# FabSoft Desktop Automation Driver - Sample SMTP Email Delivery
Sending email via SMTP is one of the most common methods of delivering documents. This project will demonstrate how to connect the FabSoft Desktop Automation Driver (DAD) with the common method of communication. 

**This sample demonstrates:**

* Creating the properties available in the workflow (Example: SMTP requires Credentials, Server Name, Sender, Recipient, etc.).
* Submitting the printed document to a SMTP server (Example: Uses the built-in SMTP Client available in the Microsoft .NET Framework).

The FabSoft Desktop Automation Driver (DAD) API documentation is available at: https://github.com/fabsoft-upd/SamplePlugin/wiki
